# ShopHeroesOptCraftTime

This project is designed to calculate the optimal settings of the workers in the game Shop Heroes. If you are interested, you are more than welcome to join and develop together! 

## How to run
You need to first install python 3.6 or higher

Clone/download the repository to your own disk, then run
```
python /path/to/main.py
```

## Dependencies
I have not packaged the tool yet, so for now you need to manually install some python packages to run:

- numpy
- wxpython
- json

## The algorithm
The way of calculating the skill points is explained in this blog:
